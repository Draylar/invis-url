### Usage

Paste or type any URL into the primary input box and copy the URL it gives you back. This URL uses hidden characters, so nobody will be able to tell where it goes before they click on it!
Perfect for (NOT ILLEGAL) activities such as surprising your friends with cute images of dogs, sending words of encouragement, and doing anything but Rick-Rolling.
